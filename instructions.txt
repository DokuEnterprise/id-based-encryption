This message has been encrypted using the Stanford IBE (Identity-Based
Encryption) system. To decrypt it, download the appropriate files from

http://crypto.stanford.edu/ibe/download.html

For now, the only available prorgam is the command-line "ibe" program.
(The plugins need to be updated for the new system so have been
temporarily removed.)

	ibe request <your email address>

to have your private key share mailed to you. (You'll be asked to make up
a password for it, so that eavesdroppers can't read it while it's in transit.)
At the moment there is only one private key generator so you only need one
private key share.

Then once you receive it, save the private key share to a file, and type:

	ibe combine <your email address> <share key file>

This will work out your private key from the share, and save it to another
file. To be on the safe side, it encrypts the file so you will be asked
for a password for this.

Now you can finally decrypt this message. Type

	ibe decrypt < <filename>

to decrypt a file.
